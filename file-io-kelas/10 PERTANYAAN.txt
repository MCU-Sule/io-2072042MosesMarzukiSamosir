Thihs to add
1. Add File Chooser implementation to save and load file --> Done
2. add save and load 2 using java nio --> Done
3. add error scenario that potentially happen ?
	- list all error scenario that potentially happen ?

	- no selected data/file when use file chooser
	- load data with other than json file
4. is it better to save data on plain text or json ? Why?
	I think json is better than txt file. 
	Because A json/xml file can be interpreted directly into 
	the language and converted to native variables, 
	such as arrays, strings, integers, etc
5. is there a better format to json to store data on plain text ?
	- .XML
	- .YAML
6. is it better to save data on file instead of dedicated database ?
	Yes, because XML more secure than json. And YAML is more readability than Json.
7. Can you test if a specific file exist in specified path with java ?
	YES, Using Files.exist() and Files.notExist().First we need path by using Files.createTempFile()
8. Can you test if a specific directory exist in specified path with java ?
	YES, Using Files.exist() and Files.notExist().First we need path by using Files.createTempDirectory()
9. Can you delete or move using java ?
	Yes i can, By using Files.move()
	First we need to get file path and than we can rename file by using file.resolveSibling("newname")
	and than we can move file to new directory with get new directory and exec it using 
	Files.move(file,newDir.resolve(file.getfilename()),StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE, 
    	StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING); 
10. Can you think of potentiall security problem when you allow java to free change file on your computer?
	I think java malware is one of many problem in this problem. 
	just as we access paths and manipulate data, so can malware too.
